# Chill-O-Meter
Having trouble getting your work done? Use the Chill-o-meter! This product will allow you to split your time between work and breaks without too much or too little leeway. 


## Inspiration

## What it does

This device will allow you to split your time between work and breaks without too much or too little leeway. It does this by splitting your time into three segments, time when you should be working, indicated by a green light, time when you are approaching a break, indicated by a yellow light and a fan too cool you off a bit, and time when you should take a break indicated by a red light and the same fan spinning at a stronger speed. At the same time all three of these stages are accompanied by different encouraging messages to keep you motivated!

## How we built it

We built this project using a simple Arduino circuit with a DC motor and a liquid crystal LCD display.

## Challenges we ran into

As computer science majors only really used to software, we had to learn how to work with circuits and hardware in general for the first time along the way. We picked up the knowledge that we learned from workshops, research, and the hardware team to learn how to make a circuit of our own, even when we had to start from scratch a bunch of times.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We got our first circuit to work, even working with hardware and libraries we weren't familiar with.

## What we learned

working with Arduino, building circuits, CAD and 3D printing

## What's next for Chill-O-Meter

We can further the refine this project by making it more compact and improving the cable management.
